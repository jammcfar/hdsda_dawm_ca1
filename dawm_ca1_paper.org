* Introduction

This section will use a groceries transaction dataset.

The apriori algorithm will be used here.

* Tidy data principles
- Each variable (attribute, feature) measured should be in one column
- Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row
- There should be one table for each topic of interest.  For example, a different table for a personâ€™s finance and health data
- If you have multiple tables, they should include a column that allows them to be linked.  For the example in 3 above we might link a finance table and a health table with a common identifier such as a â€˜person IDâ€™

  When importing the dataseta

  It was immediately apparent that the dataset was in wide format.
  There is only one topic of interest, so splitting and linking tables was not necessary.

  After fixing the dates column, which was not parsed correctly upon import, a row ID column was created. The dataset now had 4 variables; the id column, dates, items and the presence/absence of an item.  The data was transformed to a long-format. When transformed in this way, each variable forms a column and each observation forms a row. This is Codd's third normal form.

  To convert the tidy dataset to a format that could be converted to a transaction object, the data was expanded into wide format, with one column per item.
